Custom color scheme for 256 color terminals that I've personally used and tuned since I created it in February.  I'm a perfectionist when it comes to this kind of thing, and I've spent a LOT of time fine tuning the colors to be both functional and pleasing to the eye.

Does not currently support the gvim or instances of vim based in a GUI.
